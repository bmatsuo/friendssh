friendssh - Add RSA key authentication to ssh hosts.

SYNOPSIS:

    $ friendssh bryan@remote.compute.cluster.net
    Password:
    $ ssh bryan@remote.compute.cluster.net
    Welcome to your remote compute cluster!
    > 

USAGE:
    friendssh [-h] [-f] [-t KEYTYPE] [-p PASSPHRASE] [USER@]HOST

ARGUMENTS:
    HOST  Hostname or address of an ssh server.
    USER  Username at the specified host.

OPTIONS:
    -t KEYTYPE
          Use a key type other than 'rsa'.
    -p PASSPHRASE
          Use a specified passphrase for any created key.
    -f    Force copying of the public key and athentication.
    -h    Print a help message.

DESCRIPTION:
    The friendssh program performs all the necessary steps in setting up
    RSA public/private key for your computer on a remote host. friendssh
    will generate an RSA key pair if you do not already have one at
    '~/.ssh/id_rsa' and '~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub'. It then copies your public
    key to the remote host, organizes it, and adds it to the list of
    authorized keys.

ARGUMENTS
    HOST is the address of a remote ssh server. USER is your account
    username on HOST. USER defaults to the environment variable $USER
    when not provided.

FUTURE ADDITIONS:
    Non-RSA key types.
    Improved error handling 
        (i.e. key is on host, but not in the authorized list).
