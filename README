friendssh - Easily add RSA key authentication to ssh hosts.

USAGE: friendssh [-h|--help] [USER@]HOST

DESCRIPTION:
    The friendssh program performs all the necessary steps in setting up
    RSA public/private key for your computer on a remote host. friendssh
    will generate an RSA key pair if you do not already have one at
    '~/.ssh/id_rsa' and '~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub'. It then copies your public
    key to the remote host, organizes it, and adds it to the list of
    authorized keys.

ARGUMENTS
    HOST is the address of a remote ssh server. USER is your account
    username on HOST. USER defaults to the environment variable $USER
    when not provided.

FUTURE ADDITIONS:
    Non-RSA key types.
    Improved error handling 
        (i.e. key is not host, but not in the authorized list).
